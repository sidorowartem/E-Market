# E-Market
Study project for single developer.

Main idea is to create web market. For example warket will be for selling household appliances. 

Application should be developed step-by-step. In the project wiki there will be base idea of each development iteration with required technologies and task. Student should fork the project and implement a task for the iteration. After student finishes the iteration I'll push changes "how it was done". No additional servers and apps like JIRA or Sonar is needed for the project. 


Iterations(tasks) can be found on project wiki https://github.com/sidorowartem/E-Market/wiki
